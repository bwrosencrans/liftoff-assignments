## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Calorie Tracker with a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) formula to calculate weekly weight loss or weight gain based on nutrition goals.

### Features
1) Calorie Tracker (i.e. input food items for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks in between).

2) User input area to update personal BMR.

3) When a specific type of food is added by the user, it will be stored in the database for future use, so it is not redundant to readd foods.

4) Calculated projected weight loss or weight gain based on diet and level of activity.  See link for more information regarding Basal Metabolic Rate as it relates to activity level (exercise): http://www.checkyourhealth.org/eat-healthy/cal_calculator.php

5) When the user understands their caloric intake, and how it affects their weight, he or she can reduce or increase consumption.  For example, I could have maintained my weight for week 1 so will need to cut out 250 calories per day in order to reach my goal of losing X amount of weight in pounds.

### Technologies
CSS, HTML, Java, MySQL Workbench, JavaScript, MVC, Thymeleaf, BootStrap
